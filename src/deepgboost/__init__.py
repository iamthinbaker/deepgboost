DeepGBoost — Distributed Gradient Boosting Forest

A deep-graph tree ensemble algorithm combining boosting and bagging in a
neural-network-like layered architecture.

Based on the paper:
    "A generalized decision tree ensemble based on the NeuralNetworks
     architecture: Distributed Gradient Boosting Forest (DGBF)"
     Delgado-Panadero et al., Applied Intelligence 53, 22991–23003 (2023).

Sklearn API::

    from deepgboost import DeepGBoostRegressor, DeepGBoostClassifier

    reg = DeepGBoostRegressor(n_layers=20, n_trees=10, learning_rate=0.05)
    reg.fit(X_train, y_train)
    preds = reg.predict(X_test)

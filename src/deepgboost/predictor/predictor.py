"""
Inference module for DeepGBoost.

Decouples the forward pass from the training loop, mirroring XGBoost's
``predictor`` module.  ``DeepGBoostPredictor`` knows only about the trained
``graph_``, ``weights_``, and optional ``linear_models_`` — it does not
touch any training state.

    Stateless inference engine for a trained DeepGBoost model.

        Compute raw (untransformed) ensemble predictions.

        Implements the forward pass of Algorithm 1 (paper sec. 3):

        1. Initialise a scalar accumulator at ``model.prior_``.
        2. For each layer l:
           a. Collect the T bagged trees' 1-D predictions.
           b. Apply the layer's learned weight vector to combine them.
           c. Add the weighted sum to the accumulator.
        3. If ``linear_projection`` is active, add the linear correction.

        Parameters
        ----------
        model : DGBFModel
            A fitted model with ``graph_``, ``weights_``, ``prior_``,
